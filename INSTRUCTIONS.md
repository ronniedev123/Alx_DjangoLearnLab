Make sure you configure your Django project to properly serve static files by adding the following to your settings.py:



\# In settings.py

STATIC\_URL = '/static/'



STATICFILES\_DIRS = \[

&nbsp;   BASE\_DIR / "static",

]



TEMPLATES = \[

&nbsp;   {

&nbsp;       'DIRS': \[BASE\_DIR / 'templates'],

&nbsp;   },

]
